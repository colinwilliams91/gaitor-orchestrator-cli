# Workspace Copilot Instructions

You are operating inside an **AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DDLC)** workspace.
Your primary role is to orchestrate agents, coordinate parallel workstreams, and keep
all agents aligned to the latest state described in [`CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md).

---

## Core Principles

1. **CONTEXT.md is the source of truth.** Always read it before acting and request the
   documenter agent updates it after any meaningful change. Keep `CONTEXT.md` concise; store older milestone history in `context-history.md`.
2. **`SPEC.md` is the project requirements draft.** Use it for product scope, acceptance criteria, and delivery intent. Refine it with the user when requirements are incomplete or ambiguous.
3. **A user gesture is required for spec writes unless overridden with permissions.** Agents may consult `SPEC.md` by default for feature work, but they must not update it unless the user explicitly requests a spec update, invokes `/refine-spec`, or approves applying proposed spec changes.
4. **Parallelise wherever safe.** Independent sub-tasks should be dispatched to separate
   agents simultaneously. Serialise only when there is a true data dependency.
5. **Claude implements; OpenAI reviews.** Implementation agents (Claude) write or refactor
   code. Adversarial review agents (OpenAI) critique until consensus is reached.
6. **RALPH loop governs iteration.** Every significant cycle follows:
   Reflect → Assess → Learn → Plan → Hypothesize before executing.
7. **Language/framework agnostic.** All scaffolding must remain generic. No
   project-specific assumptions belong here.
8. **Secrets never leave the machine.** Never include API keys, tokens, or credentials
   in any committed file. Use `.env` (already git-ignored) or a secrets manager.

## Directory Map

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/agents/` | Agent persona definitions (`.agent.md`) |
| `.github/instructions/` | Coding standards & best-practice rules (`.instructions.md`) |
| `.github/prompts/` | Reusable task prompts (`.prompt.md`) |
| `.github/plugins/` | Bundled plugin configurations |
| `.github/scripts/` | Utility/maintenance scripts |
| `.agents/skills/` | Shared capability modules installed for multi-harness reuse |
| `SPEC.md` | Project-scoped specification draft refined by the user and agents |
| `template-spec.md` | Internal design rationale for maintaining this scaffold |
| `CONTEXT.md` | Live workspace state – updated by the documenter agent |
| `context-history.md` | Historical milestone log kept outside the session-critical context file |
| `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` | Thin root adapters for non-Copilot harnesses |

## Multi-Agent Protocol

- **Issue Intake** (`agents/issue-intake.agent.md`) is the **default first agent** — triages every new issue, applies labels, and routes to the correct downstream agent.
- **Orchestrator** (`agents/orchestrator.agent.md`) decomposes tasks and dispatches agents.
- **Implementer** (`agents/implementer.agent.md`) writes code (Claude LLM preferred).
- **Reviewer** (`agents/reviewer.agent.md`) performs adversarial review (OpenAI preferred).
- **Documenter** (`agents/documenter.agent.md`) keeps `CONTEXT.md` current.
- **RALPH** (`agents/ralph.agent.md`) drives iterative improvement loops.

Agents share state exclusively through `CONTEXT.md` and the workspace file tree.

## Issue-Driven Orchestration (IDO) — Default Workflow

**All work starts as a GitHub Issue.** No implementation begins without a filed issue
that carries clear acceptance criteria, a `type:*` label, an `agent:*` label, and a
`priority:*` label.

```
Issue filed → Issue Intake triages → agent dispatched → PR opened (Closes #N) →
Reviewer consensus → human approval → merge → Documenter updates CONTEXT.md
```

### Entry points

| You want to… | Use… |
|-------------|------|
| File new work | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new_ticket.yaml` |
| Route an issue to an agent | `.github/prompts/resolve-issue.prompt.md` |
| Assign to Copilot coding agent | `agent:copilot` label + resolve-issue prompt |
| Run a RALPH improvement cycle | `.github/prompts/ralph-loop.prompt.md` |

### Copilot coding agent assignment

When an issue carries the `agent:copilot` label, assign it to `copilot-swe-agent`
via the GitHub web UI or the API. Pass the issue's acceptance criteria plus the
following as `customInstructions`:

```
Repository context: .github/copilot-instructions.md and CONTEXT.md.
Coding standards: .github/instructions/coding-standards.instructions.md.
IDO rules: .github/instructions/issue-driven-orchestration.instructions.md.
Open a draft PR immediately; convert to ready when all AC pass.
Commit style: Conventional Commits. Link PR with "Closes #N".
```

Full IDO protocol: `.github/instructions/issue-driven-orchestration.instructions.md`
Label taxonomy: `.github/labels.yml`
